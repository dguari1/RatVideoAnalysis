Software to track whisker displacement 
Welcome to the RatVideoAnalysis wiki!

Whisker Analysis is a tool designed for whisker tracking in top-view, high-speed video recordings of head-fixed rats.

This graphical user interface provides tools for visualization of recorded video, processing of individual frames, and whisker tracking. Results can be reviewed visually as a time series or as a vector plot in each recorded frame.

Software was developed in Python using PyQt and OpenCV. UI includes the option to execute the algorithm in parallel using python multiprocessing functionality.
To start using the software open WhiskerAnalysis.py

An example of results can be found in .../demo_results/rat_whiskers.mp4

Video examples (Frames of video) for processing can be found in .../demo_frames

A detailed explanation of the usage can be locate in the wiki
