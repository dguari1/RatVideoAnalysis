Software to track whisker displacement 
Welcome to the RatVideoAnalysis wiki!

Whisker Analysis is a tool designed for whisker tracking in top-view, high-speed video recordings of head-fixed rats.

This graphical user interface provides tools for visualization of recorded video, processing of individual frames, and whisker tracking. Results can be reviewed visually as a time series or as a vector plot in each recorded frame.

Software was developed in Python using PyQt and OpenCV. UI includes the option to execute the algorithm in parallel using python multiprocessing functionality.
